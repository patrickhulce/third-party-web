## Goals

1.  Quantify the impact of third party scripts on the web.
1.  Identify the third party scripts on the web that have the greatest performance cost.
1.  Give developers the information they need to make informed decisions about which third parties to include on their sites.
1.  Incentivize responsible third party script behavior.

## Methodology

[HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) is an inititiave that tracks how the web is built. Twice a month, ~4 million sites are crawled with [Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) on mobile. Lighthouse breaks down the total script execution time of each page and attributes the execution to a URL. Using [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), this project aggregates the script execution to the origin-level and assigns each origin to the responsible entity.

## Data

### Summary

Across top ~1 million sites, ~800 origins account for ~65% of all script execution time with the top 100 entities already accounting for ~59%. Third party script execution is the majority chunk of the web today, and it's important to make informed choices.

### How to Interpret

Each entity has a number of data points available.

1.  **Usage (Total Number of Occurrences)** - how many scripts from their origins were included on pages
1.  **Total Impact (Total Execution Time)** - how many seconds were spent executing their scripts across the web
1.  **Average Impact (Average Execution Time)** - on average, how many milliseconds were spent executing each script
1.  **Category** - what type of script is this

### Third Parties by Category

This section breaks down third parties by category. The third parties in each category are ranked from first to last based on the average impact of their scripts. Perhaps the most important comparisons lie here. You always need to pick an analytics provider, but at least you can pick the most well-behaved analytics provider.

#### Overall Breakdown

Unsurprisingly, ads account for the largest identifiable chunk of third party script execution. Other balloons as a category primarily due to Google Tag Manager which is used to deliver scripts in multiple categories. Google Tag Manager script execution alone is responsible for more than half of the "Mixed / Other" category.

### Third Parties by Total Impact

This section highlights the entities responsible for the most script execution across the web. This helps inform which improvements would have the largest total impact.

## Future Work

1.  Introduce URL-level data for more fine-grained analysis, i.e. which libraries from Cloudflare/Google CDNs are most expensive.
1.  Expand the scope, i.e. include more third parties and have greater entity/category coverage.

## FAQs

### I don't see entity X in the list. What's up with that?

This can be for one of several reasons:

1.  The entity does not have at least 100 references to their origin in the dataset.
1.  The entity's origins have not yet been identified. See [How can I contribute?](#contribute)

### How is the "Average Impact" determined?

The HTTP Archive dataset includes Lighthouse reports for each URL on mobile. Lighthouse has an audit called "bootup-time" that summarizes the amount of time that each script spent on the main thread. The "Average Impact" for an entity is the total execution time of scripts whose domain matches one of the entity's domains divided by the total number of occurences of those scripts.

```
Average Impact = Total Execution Time / Total Occurences
```

### How does Lighthouse determine the execution time of each script?

Lighthouse's bootup time audit attempts to attribute all toplevel main-thread tasks to a URL. A main thread task is attributed to the first script URL found in the stack. If you're interested in helping us improve this logic, see [Contributing](#contributing) for details.

### The data for entity X seems wrong. How can it be corrected?

Verify that the origins in `data/entities.json` are correct. Most issues will simply be the result of mislabelling of shared origins. If everything checks out, there is likely no further action and the data is valid. If you still believe there's errors, file an issue to discuss futher.

### How can I contribute?

Only about 90% of the third party script execution has been assigned to an entity. We could use your help identifying the rest! See [Contributing](#contributing) for details.

### Updating the Entities

The domain->entity mapping can be found in `data/entities.json`. Adding a new entity is as simple as adding a new array item with the following form.

```js
{
    "name": "Facebook",
    "homepage": "https://www.facebook.com",
    "categories": ["social"],
    "domains": [
        "www.facebook.com",
        "connect.facebook.net",
        "staticxx.facebook.com",
        "static.xx.fbcdn.net",
        "m.facebook.com"
    ]
}
```

### Updating Attribution Logic

The logic for attribution to individual script URLs can be found in the [Lighthouse repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse). File an issue over there to discuss further.

### Updating the Data

The query used to compute the origin-level data is in `sql/origin-execution-time-query.sql`, running this against the latest Lighthouse HTTP Archive should give you a JSON export of the latest data that can be checked in at `data/YYYY-MM-DD-origin-scripting.json`.

### Updating this README

This README is auto-generated from the templates `lib/` and the computed data. In order to update the charts, you'll need to make sure you have `cairo` installed locally in addition to `yarn install`.

```bash
# Install `cairo` and dependencies for node-canvas
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib
```
